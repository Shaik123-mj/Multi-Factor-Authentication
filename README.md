# Multi-Factor-Authentication
A MERN stack project that integrates MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) to enhance security. The application enables users to register and login securely, with an additional authentication layer using OTP (One-Time Password) or other second-factor methods, ensuring that access is protected beyond just username and password credentials.
